This is a Chrome extension is for folks who prefer bigger text. 

Hello!

Thank you for caring about larger text! 

One fateful day our Google Chrome extension will enlarge an "in focus" area of a webpage. I would like to bring peace to war between browser zoom and local zoom by bringing in a third party, enlarge. It's nice that everyone wants to help but sometimes when magnifying a webpage different parts of the page magnify in unhelpful or even impeding ways. For example as a large text enthusiast, I was unable to use many educational products in a way that my goofy eyes could do comfortably. There was much squinting, copying and pasting, and little tears of exhaustion-- all of which are avoidable! It took a little longer than anticipated to learn javascript so at the moment our user can select where they would like to enlarge and we know about it but do nothing. This is not ideal, but a solid start. 

An accessible world is one that is better for everyone! 

Happy hacking!

It is the little things that make a big difference especially when they are made less little!
